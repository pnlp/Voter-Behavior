(APPLAUSE) Earlier today,                      Senator Kerry called with his congratulations. We had a                      really good phone call. He was very gracious. Senator Kerry                      waged a spirited campaign, and he and his supporters can                      be proud of their efforts. (APPLAUSE) Laura and I wish                      Senator Kerry and Teresa and their whole family all our                      best wishes.

We thank you for taking time out of your                      day. I've got something to tell you. I'm traveling Ohio                      a lot. I'm asking for the vote, and I'm asking for your                      help. (Applause.) We have a duty in this country to vote.                      You may have heard, the election is right around the corner.                      (Laughter.) And I'm asking, you get your friends and neighbors                      to go to the polls. Make sure our fellow Republicans vote.                      Make sure independents vote. Find some discerning Democrats,                      and there's a lot across the state of Ohio. (Applause.)                      And get them headed to the polls, and remind them, if they                      want a safer America, a stronger America, and a better                    America, to put me and Dick Cheney back in office.

The reason why I'm                      here, with your help we'll carry the state of New Jersey                    in November. (Applause.)"

(Applause.) We have a little difference                      of opinion about the heart and soul -- some of them think                    you can find it in Hollywood.

You know, Marc, you're right,                      the National Urban League is a vital and important part                      of the American scene. And I think the reason why is, not                      only is the mission important, but the people involved                      in the Urban League are dignified, decent American citizens.                    And I am honored to be in your presence."

And                      with your help, I look forward to being your guest next                    year, as well. (Applause.)"

John Ashcroft told me this morning that St.                      Charles was the first capital of Missouri. (Applause.)                      Today, the way things look, St. Charles is the capital                      of Bush-Cheney country. (Applause.) I always enjoy coming                      to the St. Louis area. You might remember the last time                      I was here, I brought my 30-mile-an-hour fastball.

Listen, I was talking to Tommy and I said, you know,                      I need to get back to Wisconsin. He said, you sure do.                      I said, do you know your way around there? (Laughter.)                      So he and I have gotten on this modest little bus here.                      (Laughter.) And we're going to travel your beautiful state.                    (Applause.)"
