met with a swift and certain respons that wa the mindset of the 1990 while al qaeda wa plan the attack on america after septemb the 11th our object in the war on terror is not to wait for the next attack and respond but to prevent attack by take the fight to the enemi (applause)in our debat senat said that remov saddam hussein wa a mistak becaus the threat wa not immin the problem with thi

those terrorist is a divers from the war on terror (laughter) you hear all that and you can understand whi somebodi would make a face (laughter and applause)mi oppon endless backandforth on iraq is part of a larger misunderstand in the war on terror senat is propos polici and doctrin that would weaken america and make the world more danger hi senat approach the world with a septemb the 10th mindset he declar in hi convent speech that ani attack will be met with a swift and certain respons that wa the mindset of the 1990 while al qaeda wa plan the attack on america after septemb the 11th our object in the war on terror is not to wait for the next attack and respond but to prevent attack by take the fight to the enemi (applause)in our debat senat said that remov saddam hussein wa a mistak becaus the threat wa not immin the problem with thi approach is obviou if america wait until a threat is at our doorstep it might be too late to save live (applause) tyrant and terrorist will not give us polit notic befor they launch an attack on our countri (applause) i refus to stand by while danger gather in the world after septemb the 11th the path to safeti is the path of action and i will continu to defend the peopl of the unit state of america (applause) thank you all thank you allmi oppon ha also announc the doctrin declar that american action in the war on terror must pass a global testaudi booo!th presid under thi test america would not be abl to act quickli against threat becaus wed be sit around wait for our grade from other nation and other leader (laughter)i have a

first ran for congress he argu that american troop should be deploy onli at the direct of the unit nationsaudi booo!th presid now he chang hi mind (laughter) no he ha in all fair but it is a window into hi think over the year senat ha look for everi excus to constrain america action in the world these day he prais america broad coalit in the persian gulf war but in 1991 he critic those coalit member as shadow battlefield alli who bare carri a burden sound familiar at that time he vote against the war if that coalit didnt pass hi global test clearli noth will (laughter and applause) thi mindset would paralyz america in a danger world ill never hand over america secur decis to foreign leader and intern bodi that do not have america interest at heart (applause)mi oppon doctrin ha other consequ especi for our men and women in uniform my oppon support the intern crimin court which would allow unaccount foreign prosecutor and judg to put american soldier on trialaudi booo!th presid that would be a legal nightmar for our troop my fellow citizen as long as im your presid american in uniform will answer to the offic and law of the unit state not to the intern crimin court in the hagueaudi four more years! four more years! four more years!th presid the senat speak often about hi plan to strengthen america allianc but he got an odd way of do it in the middl of the war he chosen to insult america fight alli by call them window dress and the coalit of the coerc and the bribe the italian who die in nasiriyah were not window dress they were hero in the war on terror (applause) the british and the pole at the head of the multin divis in iraq were not coerc or bribe they have fought and some have die in the caus of freedom these good alli and dozen of other deserv the respect of all american not the scorn of a politician (applause)instead the senat would have america bend over backward to satisfi a hand of govern with agenda differ from our own thi is my oppon alliancebuild strategi brush off your best friend fawn over your critic and that is no way to gain the respect of the world (applause)mi oppon say he ha a plan for iraq part of it should sound pretti familiar it alreadi known as the plan (laughter and applause) senat suggest we train iraqi troop which weve been do for month just thi week iraqi forc back by coalit troop fought brave to take the citi of samarra from the terrorist and baathist and insurg (applause) senat senat is propos that we have that iraq have elect (laughter) those elect are alreadi schedul for januari (laughter and applause) he want the un to be involv in those elect well the un is alreadi therether wa one element of the senat there one element of senat s plan that a new element he talk about artifici timet to pull our troop out of iraq he sent the signal that america overrid goal in iraq would be to leav even if the job isnt done that may satisfi hi polit need but it complic the essenti work were do in iraq (applause) the iraqi peopl the iraqi peopl need to know that america will not cut and run when their freedom is at stake (applause) our soldier and marin need to know that america will honor their servic and sacrific by complet the mission (applause) and our enemi in iraq need to know that they can never outlast the will of america (applause)sen assur us that he the one to win a war he call a mistak an error and a divers but you cant win a war you dont believ in fight (applause) in iraq senat ha a strategi of retreat i have a strategi of victori (applause) weve return sovereignti to the iraqi peopl ahead of schedul weve train about 100000 iraqi soldier polic offic and other secur personnel and that total will rise to 125000 by yearend weve alreadi alloc more than $7 billion for reconstruct effort so more iraqi can see the benefit of freedom were work with a coalit of some 30 nation to provid secur other nation are help with debt relief and reconstruct aid for iraqi and although the terrorist will tri to stop them iraq will hold free elect in januari becaus the iraqi peopl want and deserv to govern themselv (applause)i understand some american have strong concern about our role in iraq i respect the fact that they take thi issu serious becaus it is a seriou matter i assur them were in iraq becaus i deepli believ it is necessari and right and critic to the outcom of the war on terror if anoth terror regim were allow to emerg in iraq the terrorist would find a home a sourc of fund vital support they would correctli conclud that free nation do not have the will to defend themselv if iraq becom a free societi at the heart of the middl east an alli in the war on terror a model of hope reform in a region that need hope reform the terrorist will suffer a crush defeat and everi free nation will be more secur (applause)thi is whi democrat senat joe lieberman call iraq a crucial battl in the global war on terror thi is whi prime minist toni blair ha call the struggl in iraq the crucibl in which the futur of global terror will be determin thi is whi the terrorist are fight with desper cruelti they know their own futur is at stake iraq is no divers it is the place where civil is take a decis stand against chao and terror and we must not waver (applause)unfortun my oppon ha been known to waver (laughter) hi wellchosen word and ration cannot explain whi he vote to author forc against saddam hussein and then vote against money for bullet and vehicl and bodi armor for the troop on the ground he tri to clear it all up by say i actual did vote for the $87 billion befor i vote against it now he say he made a mistak in how he talk about the war the mistak here is not what senat said the mistak is what he did in vote against fund for american in combat (applause) that is the kind of waver a nation at war can never afforda a candid my oppon promis to defend america the problem is as a senat for two decad he ha built a record of weak the record show he twice led effort to gut our intellig servic budget the record show he vote against mani of the weapon that won the cold war and are vital to current militari oper and the record show he ha vote more than 50 time against missil defens system that would help protect us from the threat of a danger worldi have a record in offic as well and all american have seen that
